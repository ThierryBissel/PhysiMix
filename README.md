# PhysiMix

This project is a sound controller for every applications on your windows computer (I didn't try on linux or MacOS)

For this project you will need an Arduino, a potentiometer, a button, a pull-down resistor (I used a 10kΩ but a 1kΩ is enough) and a I2C screen (I used this one: https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B09BFK48GJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1).
